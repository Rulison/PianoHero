PianoHero
=========

Guitar Hero, but with a Piano.  Squares representing notes travel down the screen.  At a certain point the user must press the appropriate key(s) to get points.

Uses the Java swing library a lot.

Has two songs: "Don't Leave Me" by Regina Spektor and a midi version of "Someone Like You" by Adele.

I experiment working with two different types of sound files, .wav and .midi.  Wav files sound better, but midis can be played at different speeds, which makes sense for a Guitar Hero type game.

When "Quit" is pressed, if a song is playing, the game takes the user to the high score screen.  If a song is not playing, the program ends.
